Having early Scrum calls with offshore developers can provide several benefits, which are particularly important when working with distributed teams. These early calls help in fostering effective collaboration and project management. Here are some key advantages:

Alignment on Goals and Priorities: Early Scrum calls ensure that everyone on the team, regardless of their location, is aligned with the project's goals and priorities. This shared understanding helps in avoiding misunderstandings and misaligned efforts.

Clarity on User Stories: Discussing user stories and requirements during early Scrum calls helps clarify any doubts or ambiguities. Offshore developers can ask questions and seek clarification on tasks, reducing the chances of misinterpretation and rework later in the development process.

Timely Issue Resolution: Early calls provide a platform for offshore developers to raise any issues or blockers they encounter. This proactive approach allows the Scrum team to address these issues promptly, preventing delays in the project timeline.

Reduced Dependencies: When offshore developers have a clear understanding of their tasks and dependencies, they can work more independently. Early Scrum calls can help identify and resolve dependencies upfront, reducing delays caused by waiting for input from other team members.

Improved Communication: Regular communication through early Scrum calls fosters a culture of open and transparent communication. Team members can share updates, progress, and challenges, creating a stronger sense of teamwork and collaboration.

Iterative Feedback: Early Scrum calls provide an opportunity for iterative feedback. Offshore developers can showcase their work and receive feedback from product owners, Scrum Masters, and other team members, allowing for course corrections and improvements early in the development cycle.

Time Zone Considerations: When working across different time zones, early Scrum calls can be scheduled at a time that accommodates both onshore and offshore team members. This ensures that everyone has an opportunity to participate in discussions and planning.

Improved Product Quality: With offshore developers actively participating in early Scrum calls, they can better understand the quality standards and expectations of the product. This understanding can lead to higher-quality deliverables.

Risk Mitigation: Identifying issues and risks early in the project through regular communication can help the team take proactive measures to mitigate them. This proactive risk management can prevent major setbacks later in the project.

Team Building: Regular interactions through early Scrum calls contribute to team building and the development of a strong team culture. Team members get to know each other better, fostering trust and collaboration.

Knowledge Sharing: Early Scrum calls provide a platform for knowledge sharing. Offshore developers can share insights, best practices, and lessons learned, benefiting the entire team.

In summary, early Scrum calls with offshore developers enhance communication, alignment, and collaboration within distributed Scrum teams. They help in clarifying requirements, resolving issues, and mitigating risks, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.
