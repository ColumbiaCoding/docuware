Same-Day Paving Request Payload Generation for Maximo Integration

As a developer responsible for enhancing our construction project management software, I want to create a feature for generating payloads specific to the "Same-Day Paving" order type and its associated Work Order Line Items (WOLIs). This feature will include mapping updates to accommodate the new order type and WOLI, payload generation, and integration with Maximo services.

Acceptance Criteria:

AC1. Mapping Updates:
   - Update the system's data mappings to include the "Same-Day Paving" order type and its associated fields.
   - Ensure that the mapping updates are correctly configured to extract and process relevant data for payload generation.

2. Payload Generation:
   - Develop a function or module within the system to generate payloads for "Same-Day Paving" requests.
   - The payload should include all necessary data fields, such as order details, vendor-contractor group, paving code, and restoration request data.
   - Ensure that the payload adheres to the required format and standards for integration with Maximo.

3. Callout Integration:
   - Establish an integration point within the system that allows for the automated sending of generated payloads to Maximo services.
   - Implement the necessary authentication and security protocols to ensure a secure and reliable connection with Maximo.

4. Testing and Validation:
   - Thoroughly test the payload generation feature to verify that it accurately captures and formats data for "Same-Day Paving" requests.
   - Test the integration with Maximo to confirm that payloads are successfully transmitted and received.
   - Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to handle any issues that may arise during payload generation or integration.

5. Documentation:
   - Provide detailed documentation for administrators and support teams on how to configure and use the payload generation feature.
   - Document the integration setup with Maximo, including any required credentials or configurations.

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Ensure that the payload generation process is optimized for efficiency to handle a potentially large volume of "Same-Day Paving" requests without significant performance degradation.

7. Monitoring and Alerts:
   - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track the status of payload generation and integration with Maximo.
   - Set up alerts to notify administrators of any failures or issues with the integration.

8. Review and Approval:
   - Seek input and approval from relevant stakeholders, including integration specialists and project managers, to ensure that the payload generation and Maximo integration meet their requirements.

By completing this user story, we aim to enable the generation of payloads for "Same-Day Paving" requests and facilitate seamless integration with Maximo services, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our construction project management software.
