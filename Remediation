As a construction manager or inspector, I want to track and manage failed inspections through a remediation process to ensure that all identified issues are resolved promptly. This will help maintain compliance with safety standards and ensure the construction site meets the required quality criteria.

Title: Remediation for Failed Inspection

Description:
As a user, I want to initiate a remediation task for a construction site that has failed inspection. The failed inspection should be documented with details about the identified issues. The remediation task will be created to address these issues and track their resolution until they are approved for re-inspection.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Failed Inspection Record:
   - A section on the project management dashboard will be available to document the details of the failed inspection, including inspection date, location, specific issues identified, and any relevant comments or attachments.
   - The failed inspection record should be linked to the relevant construction site and associated with a unique identifier.

2. Remediation Task Creation:
   - A button labeled "Create Remediation Task" will be provided within the failed inspection record to initiate the remediation process.
   - Clicking on the "Create Remediation Task" button will open a new task creation form.
   - The task creation form will include fields to capture the following information:
     - Task title or summary
     - Description of the remediation task
     - Priority level
     - Assignee (responsible individual/team for resolving the issues)
     - Due date for completing the remediation
     - Any relevant attachments or reference materials

3. Task Assignment and Notification:
   - Once the remediation task is created, an automatic notification will be sent to the assigned person or team.
   - The assignee will be notified of their responsibility to address the identified issues and provide updates throughout the remediation process.

4. Task Progress Tracking:
   - The status of the remediation task will be tracked in real-time and visible on the project management dashboard.
   - The task status will be updated by the assignee as they progress with the remediation efforts (e.g., In Progress, Pending Review, Completed).
   - Any comments or additional information related to the task's progress can be added as updates to the task.

5. Approval for Re-Inspection:
   - Once the remediation task is marked as "Completed," the construction manager or inspector will review the resolution and verify that the issues are adequately addressed.
   - If satisfied with the resolution, the construction manager or inspector will initiate a request for re-inspection.
   - If further action is required, the task may be reopened, or additional remediation steps may be identified.

6. Closure of Remediation Process:
   - The remediation process will be considered complete once the re-inspection is passed and the construction site meets all required standards.

Additional Information:
- The failed inspection record and remediation task should be accessible only to authorized personnel.
- The dashboard should display a clear indication of the failed inspection and any open remediation tasks for quick reference.
- An option to link the failed inspection record and remediation task to related documentation or reference materials should be available.
- The system should provide the ability to generate reports on the overall status of remediation tasks and re-inspection outcomes for management review.
