Hi John,

This is not a political message. For six years, I've valued the opportunity to work and represent National Grid, but I must express my disappointment by the lack of communication/support following the horrific events that unfolded in Israel on October 7, 2023.

I don't think our leadership aims to be deliberately insenestive about these events. However, New York City and Greater is home to approximately 2 million Jews. Representing the largest Jewish communities outside of Israel (NYC only is greater than the combined totals of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem).

We not only do we operate in these areas, but National Grid employs a significant number of Jews who have witnessed videos of Jewish woman rapped, babies beheaded, and grandmothers burned alive. In equal measure, the collateral damage of non-Hamas Palestinians.


We're not asking leadership to "provide content". We're asking our leaders to stand by the National Grid values - Being a workforce that represents the communities we serve by offering support and re-enforcing the message of human dignity.

Regards,

GR
