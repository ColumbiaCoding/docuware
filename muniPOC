Sure, here's a concise proof of concept for a Municipal Dashboard:

Title: Municipal Ticket Submission Dashboard

Objective: Create a user-friendly Municipal Dashboard for leaders to submit tickets seamlessly into the outage management system.

Components:
1. **User Authentication**: Implement a secure login system for municipal leaders to access the dashboard.

2. **Ticket Submission Form**: Design an intuitive form for leaders to submit tickets. Include fields such as issue description, location, urgency, and relevant attachments.

3. **Integration with Outage Management System (OMS)**: Establish a connection between the dashboard and the OMS to ensure seamless ingestion of submitted tickets.

4. **Real-time Updates**: Provide a dashboard section for leaders to track the status of their submitted tickets in real-time, offering transparency and accountability.

5. **Notification System**: Implement an automated notification system to keep leaders informed about ticket status changes or updates.

6. **Data Security**: Prioritize data security by encrypting sensitive information during submission and transmission.

7. **User Support**: Include a support feature to assist leaders with any issues they might encounter while using the dashboard.

8. **Scalability**: Ensure the dashboard is designed to handle potential future expansions and increased usage.

9. **Accessibility**: Develop the dashboard to be accessible across different devices and platforms, allowing leaders to submit tickets conveniently.

10. **User Training**: Provide training resources or documentation to familiarize municipal leaders with the dashboard's features and functionality.

Testing:
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and address any potential issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Deployment:
- Roll out the dashboard to a limited group for initial testing, gradually expanding to the entire municipal leadership once stability is confirmed.

Feedback Loop:
- Establish a feedback mechanism for users to report any issues or suggest improvements, enabling continuous refinement of the dashboard.

This proof of concept aims to create an efficient and user-friendly Municipal Dashboard that streamlines the ticket submission process for leaders and seamlessly integrates with the outage management system.
