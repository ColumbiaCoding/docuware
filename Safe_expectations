Avoid Judgments and Criticism

As I mentioned on yesterday's call, Nick has lead the team on many areas and we need to support the business. When you asked for feedback on refinement and how we could improve our team to deliver more, my answer would be to no longer go off script and lean into the SAFe as a model for getting work done.

I've attached a SAFe document, and will follow up with a meeting to dive into where we are now and where we could be. Just one last note, I know that we're under a lot of pressure to move the business forward, especially when emotions are running high, but let's not be judgmental or make critical statements, which can make the situation worse.

Regards,

Gabriel
