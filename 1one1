I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss a matter that has been on my mind regarding my current responsibilities as a Product Owner. As you know, I have been working on two significant projects simultaneously, and I want to have an open conversation about the challenges I am facing in effectively balancing the demands of both projects.

While I am dedicated to delivering successful outcomes for both initiatives, I have realized that the complexity and scale of these projects are proving to be more demanding than I initially anticipated. As a result, I am concerned that spreading my attention across both projects might hinder the quality of work and the ability to meet deadlines effectively.

I firmly believe in the importance of delivering exceptional results and maintaining a high standard of work. To ensure that I can uphold these standards and contribute fully to the success of each project, I would like to explore options for either reallocating responsibilities or seeking additional support to share the workload.

I want to assure you that my commitment to the success of our projects remains unwavering. However, I believe that acknowledging the challenges I am facing and addressing them proactively will ultimately benefit the projects and the team. I am open to your guidance and suggestions on how to best proceed.

Could we please schedule a meeting to discuss this further? I am confident that with your insights, we can come up with a solution that ensures the best possible outcomes for both projects.
