Title: Implement ETL Audit Trail for Data Integrity Monitoring

Story:
As a data engineer, I want to establish a comprehensive ETL audit trail to track and monitor the flow of data through the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes. This will enable us to ensure data integrity, identify potential issues, and provide a detailed history of data transformations.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Configure the ETL system to log key events, such as data extraction, transformation steps, and loading into the destination.
2. Include timestamp information in the audit trail to facilitate time-based analysis and issue identification.
3. Implement alerting mechanisms for abnormal ETL behavior or failure to meet predefined data quality thresholds.
4. Ensure that the audit trail captures metadata, such as source and destination tables, field-level changes, and transformation logic applied.
5. Enable easy retrieval and analysis of the audit trail for both real-time monitoring and retrospective analysis.
6. Integrate the ETL audit trail with existing monitoring tools or dashboards used by the data engineering and operations teams.
7. Document the ETL audit trail setup and usage for future reference and onboarding.

This story aims to enhance our data governance and quality assurance processes by implementing a robust ETL audit trail system.
