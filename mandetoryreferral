Hi April and Surajit

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of concern regarding Russell Bogatz, who is currently a part of our team in the CS&E program. There have been notable anger management iceidents in Russell's behavior and conduct in recent months. These changes have raised concerns about their ability to interact with employees, and adhere to company policies.

One of the primary concerns is Russell's apparent difficulty in managing his anger and emotions. Over the past few months, there have been several instances where Russell has displayed outbursts of anger and inappropriate behavior towards colleagues and supervisors. These incidents have disrupted the workplace environment and created a sense of discomfort among the team.

Furthermore, it's become clear that Russell has been using company time and resources in the ownership or management of a marijuana shop (high-hopes.net). While we respect our employees' right to engage in legal activities outside of work, the combination of these behavioral issues concerns us. We believe that it is in the best interest of both Russell and our organization to address these concerns promptly and professionally.

To ensure that we are making informed decisions and taking appropriate action, I recommend that Russell undergo a mandetory referral as part of our company's standard procedures. This mandetory referral will help us ascertain whether there is any substance use or abuse that may be contributing to their behavioral changes. It is important to emphasize that this recommendation is made with the intention of providing Russell with the necessary support and assistance to address any issues they may be facing.

I understand that initiating a mandtory referral is a sensitive matter, and Kim and Charlene are resources from the Health and Wellness group to help manage the this process discreetly and confidentially. I value our employees and their well-being, and it is our hope that this step will help Russell regain control of his emotions and behavior, ensuring a more productive and harmonious work environment.

Please let Kim or Charlene know if you require any additional information or assistance in coordinating the mandetory. I appreciate your attention to this matter and your commitment to maintaining a positive and respectful workplace environment.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue.

Regards,

Gabriel Regus
