Hi Surajit and Ajay,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an incident that occurred earlier today involving a Russell Bogartz. Unfortunately, this is not the first time, and I believe it's important to address this issue promptly.

During the incident, Russell exhibited behavior that was disruptive and concerning. While discussion the movement of Document Management items to the Ancillary Group, Russell started yelling at Karina Khatskelevich. I intervened and told Russell to calm down, act professional, and that Karina should be treated with respect and not yelled at.

Of course this repetitive behavior impacts the work environment, and team morale.

This is not an isolated occurrence, as there have been previous instances of similar outbursts from Russell. While we understand that workplace stress and challenges are a part of our daily work life, it is essential that we maintain a respectful and professional environment for all team members. These outbursts are beginning to affect team morale and our ability to work effectively together.

I believe it would be beneficial for our team and Russell if this matter were addressed through a constructive conversation or intervention. It's possible that there may be underlying factors contributing to these outbursts that we are unaware of. I suggest considering a one-on-one conversation with Russell to understand their perspective and help them find ways to manage stress or frustrations more effectively. Additionally, if appropriate, you may want to involve HR in this discussion to ensure a fair and supportive approach.

I am willing to provide additional information or participate in any discussions aimed at resolving this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this concern.

Sincerely,

Gabriel
