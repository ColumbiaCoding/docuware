Subject: Apology and Invitation for Tomorrow's Demo

Hi Joe,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention a minor oversight on my part. Unfortunately, I missed sending you an invitation for tomorrow's demo regarding the municipal portal with our vendor, DataCapable.

The demo is set to provide a high-level overview, and Jane's team will be actively participating in the call. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this oversight may have caused.

Your insights and perspective are valuable, and I would greatly appreciate your presence at the demo. The session is scheduled for [time] tomorrow, and the meeting link is [insert link].

Once again, I apologize for any confusion, and I look forward to your participation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
