Story Description: As a Salesforce administrator (PL and PO), I want to explore the feasibility of capturing photos within the FSL to enhance user experience and streamline data collection.

Acceptance Criteria:

Photo Capture Component: Enable FSL for capturing photos. This component should include:

A button to initiate photo capture.
A preview of the captured photo.
An option to retake the photo.
An option to save the photo.
FSL Integration: Integrate the Photo Capture Component into the FSL interface so that users can easily add it to Restoration and Post Inspection Projects.

Adminstration Configuration Options: Within FSL, provide configuration options for the Photo Capture Component, such as:

The ability to specify the field in which the captured photo should be stored.
The option to customize the button label.
Photo Storage: Upon capturing and saving a photo, ensure that it is stored in the specified Salesforce record's field. Verify that the photo is displayed correctly within the record detail view.

Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the Photo Capture Component functions as expected in different browsers and devices (e.g., desktop, mobile). Verify that photos can be captured, saved, and displayed accurately.

Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation that explains how to use and configure the Photo Capture Component within FSL. Include screenshots and step-by-step instructions.

Demo and User Feedback: Collect feedback from a sample group of Salesforce users to gauge their satisfaction with the photo capture feature and identify any potential improvements.

Performance and Security: Ensure that the solution is performant and adheres to Salesforce security best practices.

The Photo Capture Component is developed and tested.
The component is successfully integrated into the FSL.
Configuration options are available and functional within the FSL.
Photos can be captured, saved, and displayed accurately within Salesforce records.
