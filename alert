Title: Automated Alert for Long-Term Inspection Follow-up

Description:
As a supervisor or contractor, I want to receive automated alerts or notifications after 30 days and 365 days of initiating an inspection to ensure timely follow-up and compliance with long-term inspection requirements. These alerts will serve as reminders to assess the construction site's ongoing condition and take any necessary actions based on the inspection findings.

Acceptance Criteria:

Notification Setup:

A new notification system will be implemented to send alerts to supervisors and contractors based on inspection initiation dates.
The system will be configurable to trigger notifications at 30 days and 365 days after the inspection initiation date.
Recipients:

The supervisor and the assigned contractor(s) will be the recipients of the automated alerts.
The supervisor will receive an alert for each inspection initiated under their supervision.
Contractors will receive notifications for inspections assigned to them.
Alert Content:

The notification will include essential details related to the inspection, such as project name, inspection date, and location.
A brief reminder of the identified issues from the original inspection report may also be included to provide context.
Notification Frequency:

The system will send alerts once every day until the recipient acknowledges or marks the notification as "Read."
If the recipient has already acknowledged the notification, they will not receive additional notifications for the same inspection until a new milestone (e.g., 365 days) is reached.
Delivery Method:

The notifications can be delivered through multiple channels, such as email, in-app messages, or mobile push notifications, based on the recipients' preferences.
Customization:

Users will have the option to customize their notification settings, including enabling or disabling notifications and selecting preferred delivery channels.
Notification History:

A log of all notifications sent to supervisors and contractors will be maintained to track the communication history.
Escalation Mechanism:

If the recipient fails to acknowledge the notification after a certain number of attempts (configurable), an escalation process will be triggered to notify relevant stakeholders or higher authorities.
Additional Information:

The inspection initiation date will be recorded when the inspector marks the inspection as "Started" or "In Progress."
The system should have robust error handling and logging to ensure the reliability of the notification process.
Security measures will be implemented to ensure that only authorized individuals can access inspection-related information and receive notifications.
The frequency and specific content of the alerts can be adjusted based on organizational requirements and best practices.
