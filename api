**Title:** Integration of IBM Cloud Data with Document Management System

**User Story:**
As a document management team lead at [Company Name], I want to integrate our IBM Cloud data with our existing Document Management System (DMS) to streamline the process of importing and organizing critical data documents. This integration will help us ensure that our document repository is up-to-date and accurate without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario 1: Initial Data Import**
- Given that I am logged into the Document Management System as an admin user,
- When I initiate the integration process,
- Then I should be prompted to authenticate with IBM Cloud credentials.

**Scenario 2: Connection Establishment**
- Given that I have provided valid IBM Cloud credentials,
- When the integration is authorized,
- Then a secure connection should be established between the Document Management System and the IBM Cloud services.

**Scenario 3: Data Selection**
- Given the connection is established,
- When configuring the integration,
- Then I should be able to select specific data sources from the IBM Cloud, such as databases, storage containers, or specific data endpoints.

**Scenario 4: Mapping Data Fields**
- Given the data sources are selected,
- When configuring the integration,
- Then I should be able to map the fields from the IBM Cloud data to the corresponding metadata fields in the Document Management System.

**Scenario 5: Schedule and Frequency**
- Given the data sources and fields are mapped,
- When configuring the integration,
- Then I should be able to set a schedule and frequency for data synchronization, including options for real-time updates or periodic batch updates.

**Scenario 6: Data Import and Update**
- Given the integration is configured,
- When the scheduled synchronization time arrives or a manual synchronization is triggered,
- Then the integration should pull the selected data from the IBM Cloud and update the corresponding documents in the Document Management System.

**Scenario 7: Error Handling and Logging**
- Given the integration process,
- When data synchronization encounters errors,
- Then detailed error logs should be generated and made accessible to administrators, allowing them to diagnose and resolve any issues.

**Scenario 8: Data Consistency**
- Given the successful integration and synchronization,
- When documents are imported or updated,
- Then the Document Management System should maintain data consistency and integrity, ensuring that the information remains accurate and up-to-date.

**Scenario 9: Notifications**
- Given the synchronization process,
- When synchronization is complete or encounters critical errors,
- Then the Document Management System should send notifications to the designated administrators, informing them of the synchronization status.

**Scenario 10: Monitoring and Maintenance**
- Given the ongoing integration,
- When changes occur in the IBM Cloud data structure or API endpoints,
- Then the integration should support easy configuration updates to adapt to these changes without causing disruptions.

**Additional Notes:**

- The integration should follow industry-standard security practices to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data during transit and storage.
- The integration should support various data formats that can be encountered in the IBM Cloud, such as JSON, XML, or CSV.
- The integration should provide clear and user-friendly documentation to guide administrators through the setup and configuration process.
- The integration should support logging and auditing features to track the synchronization history and changes made to the document repository.
